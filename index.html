            <strong>Hi Y'all!</strong> My name is Kevin Fukuhara; I am a native Seattleite born & raised. A bit about myself, I love to watch TV shows and movies on netflix; and if I can't find it... Well there are ways (ARRRRrrr). I also enjoy going to the movies, soemthing about movie theatres is awesome to me. Maybe its all the buttered and salted popcorn I mindlessly devour during the feature film or perhaps the fact that the screen is literally stupid big - mostly because it is an experience I can share with others too I guess. Lastly, my other favorite recreational hobby has to be video games. Ever since I can remember I have been an avid gamer - much happiness and fun has been spent in video games, from solo to co-op to party games alike. 
        </p>

            I also like to go outdoors when I have time (and of course when the weather permits) and go for a hike, play pick-up football from this facebook group I joined, and pick-up basketball on Sundays when a group of friends decide to get together. Sometimes I play at LA Fitness, but I left because I didnt use my membership enough lol.

            One a more productive note, I am really interested in entrepreneurship. I am excited to join this class so that I can pursue more projects like the one I lead back in college, however this time I would be one of the developers in addition to leading. You've gotten this far without clicking out, so for that, thank you! Hope to meet you soon.
